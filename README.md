Benchmarking Astrophysical Simulation Codes

Copyright (c) 2025 The AstroBenchmarks Team


## How it works

1. Fork the repo and pick a benchmark from `benchmarks/`.
2. Set up and run the benchmark using your simulation code.
3. Save your benchmark results to a JSON file (per problem specs).
4. Submit a Pull Request with your results in `results/<code>/<machine>/<benchmark>/`.

Each benchmark includes detailed specifications, reference solutions, and evaluation metrics.

Benchmarks test a variety of aspects of the code, including
runtime,
throughput,
memory usage,
and accuracy.

Results are compiled and published on a Leaderboard.
